  "body": "### Welcome to paHMM-Tree webpage.\r\n\r\npaHMM-Tree, pronounced as 'palm tree' is a phylogenetic tree inference tool that uses the principle of pairwise statistical alignment to construct a neighbour joining trees from raw sequences.\r\n\r\n### What paHMM-Tree does\r\n\r\npaHMM-Tree outputs phylogenetic trees in NEWICK format from raw sequence data in FASTA format. \r\nIt does not require a prior sequence alignment. If you feed it with aligned sequenced, the gaps will be ignored. \r\nBeing based on a pair hidden Markov model (pair-HMM) paHMM-Tree is able to integrate over all possible alignments\r\nbetween all the pairs of sequences in the data set. By doing so it accounts for alignment uncertainty. \r\n\r\n### What it does not do \r\n\r\npaHMM-Tree does not align the sequences. In principle it could, but the whole idea is to avoid conditioning on a single multiple sequence alignment (MSA). Also constructing MSAs from pairwise alignments might not lead to reliable results.\r\n\r\n### Code and compilation\r\n\r\nThe code is available on GitHub repository and accessible using the link above. The sources come with an Eclipse CDT project and a Makefile. The makefile should be good for most of the modern x86-based architectures. If your system does not support SSE2, change the compiler flags.  \r\n\r\n### Compiled binaries \r\n\r\nThe latest binaries for 64-bit Intel linux and Mac OS X versions are available here: [Intel Mac ](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6j5NXFvZHPkVEFyUm9HMlpUZ3M) and [Linux](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6j5NXFvZHPkb2ozTnZLUDdPUU0)\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nThe latest documentation can be obtained here: [paHMM-Tree User manual](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6j5NXFvZHPkMlNOb3ExTjZqaEk)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n\r\nPlease report the issues and feature requests on GitHub. For any other requests contact Marcin Bogusz at Marcin.Bogusz@ebc.uu.se \r\n",
