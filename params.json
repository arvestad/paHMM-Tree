If you feed it with aligned sequenced, the gaps will be ignored. \r\nBeing based on a pair hidden Markov model (pair-HMM) paHMM-Tree is able to integrate over all possible alignments\r\nbetween all the pairs of sequences in the data set. By doing so it accounts for alignment uncertainty. \r\n\r\n### What it does not do \r\n\r\npaHMM-Tree does not align the sequences. In principle it could, but the whole idea is to avoid conditioning on a single multiple sequence alignment (MSA). Also constructing MSAs from pairwise alignments might not lead to reliable results.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n\r\nPlease report the issues and feature requests on GitHub.
